Steps to make the project:

1) The next goal could be to display a simple list with location names using Knockoutjs. Here are the steps:

2) Define a hard-coded locations Array of location objects. => done

3) Define a ViewModel constructor. => todo

4) Instantiate the ViewModel and activate Knockout (aka apply the bindings). => todo

5) Define an observableArray in the ViewModel. => todo

6) Initialize the observableArray with the locations Array. => todo

7) Apply the ko foreach binding to an element in the view and iterate over the observableArray. => todo
